# RAG with LangChain

## Overview

This repository contains the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model, fine-tuned on a healthcare book specifically focusing on human vitals. This model is designed for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with LangChain, enabling advanced question-answering and information retrieval tasks in the healthcare domain.

## Model Details

- **Model Name**: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
- **Architecture**: Mistral-7B
- **Training Data**: Fine-tuned on a comprehensive book covering various aspects of human vitals.
- **Primary Use Case**: Designed to assist healthcare professionals, students, and researchers by providing accurate and detailed information on human vitals through natural language queries.

## Features

- **Expertise in Human Vitals**: Provides detailed insights and answers on topics related to human vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, and more.
- **RAG Integration**: Optimized for use with Retrieval-Augmented Generation setups using LangChain, enhancing the model's ability to pull in relevant external documents for more informed responses.
- **Instruction Tuning**: Fine-tuned with an instructional approach to improve the model's ability to follow user commands and provide coherent, contextually appropriate answers.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)

### Setup

1. **Load the Model**:

   Use the following code snippet to load the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model:

   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

   model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
   ```

2. **Integrate with LangChain**:

   Follow LangChain's documentation to set up a RAG pipeline. Here is a simplified example:

   ```python
   from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
   from langchain.retrievers import LocalRetriever

   retriever = LocalRetriever()  # This should be configured to point to your document store
   qa_chain = RetrievalQA(model=model, retriever=retriever, tokenizer=tokenizer)
   ```

3. **Run Queries**:

   Use the RAG pipeline to ask questions related to human vitals:

   ```python
   question = "What are the causes of blood pressure?"
   result = qa_chain.run(question)
   print(result)
   ```
