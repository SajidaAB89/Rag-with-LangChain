High Ages: A\\xa0Success That Signifies Health Challenges\\nAs we all are aware of, there is a demographic shift toward an older popula-\\ntion worldwide. The segment of people aged 80\\xa0years and more is growing \\nrapidly and those aged 100+ are growing fastest [1]. This is a sign that we \\nhave succeeded in some ways. This shift started in high-income countries. \\nHowever, for the first time in history, people can expect to live until their 60s \\nand beyond globally [2]. During the period from 2015 and 2050, the propor -\\ntion of those 60\\xa0years and more will nearly double from 12 to 22%; by 2050 \\nindividuals aged 60\\xa0years and older is expected to total two billion, up from \\n900\\xa0 million in 2015 [2]. Currently, low- and middle-income countries are \\nexperiencing the greatest demographic change; hence, all countries are now \\nfacing major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are \\nready to make the most of this demographic shift [2, 3]. Age is an aim in life \\nand not a disease. Still, with high ages, several diseases appear; now our task \\nis to ensure that the extra years are worth living. Hence, with a steadily grow-\\ning older population, the world faces a growing need of health care. In the \\nyears to come, health promotive initiatives enhancing well-being and coping \\nin the population will become ever more important. Accordingly, this book \\nprovides novel knowledge in the field of health promotion in the health care \\nservices from various parts of the world; Africa, America, Asia, Australia, and \\nEurope are represented.\\nToday, the medical perspective and treatment approaches are highly devel-\\noped giving emphasis to save lives from severe illnesses and injuries. This is \\ngood. However, a great number of patients, both in hospitals and in the munic-\\nipality health care, suffer from a lack of holistic oriented health care and sup-\\nport. Their illness is treated, but they feel scared, helpless, and lonely, \\nexperiencing meaninglessness and low quality of life. Several patients with \\nchronic or long-term conditions (heart and lung diseases, cancer, rheumato-\\nlogic diseases, dementia, diabetes, long-term intensive care patients, palliative \\npatients, mental disorders, etc.) fight and must cope with a heavy symptom \\nburden and life challenges on their own at home. These people are asking for \\nsocial support, empowerment, patient education (salus education), guidance, \\nhope, meaning, dignity, and coping strategies in order to manage their life situ-\\nation.

It is one of the common causes of \nhospitalization and readmission among the \nolder population. Patient self-management is \nessential to maintaining health and avoiding \ndisruption of life caused by frequent hospital-\nizations. However, many patients lack self- \ncare skills. This chapter provides a review on \nevidence for the importance of self- \nmanagement and strategies to educate patients \nand promote self-care while living with the \nlimitations on physical function.\nKeywords\nHealth promotion · Self-management \nSelf-efficacy · Heart failure\n19.1  Introduction\nHeart failure (HF) is not a specific disease, but a \nchronic and complex clinical syndrome that \ndeveloped as the end-result of a variety of cardio-\nvascular diseases [1]. Broadly speaking, the car -diac function of patients with HF may be impaired \nin two ways: (1) when cardiac contraction (ejec-\ntion) is reduced and the heart is unable to pump \nthe blood well, also known as “systolic dysfunc-\ntion”; and (2) when relaxation of the ventricles is \nimpaired and the heart is unable to fill the blood \nwell, also known as “diastolic dysfunction.” Both \nconditions lead to a decreased cardiac output \nwhich is insufficient to meet the body’s meta-\nbolic demands [1], therefore, other compensatory \nmechanisms must be employed to offset the \nreduction in cardiac performance. These include \nactivation of the neurohormonal and adrenergic \npathways, as well as remodeling of the heart and \nblood vessels. The systemic and persistent over -\nactivation of multiple neurohormonal and adren-\nergic pathways that aims at normalizing cardiac \noutput may offer short-term benefits, but in a \nlong run, the continued stimulatory effects on the \nheart will eventually worsen the HF progress [1]. \nClinically, the typical symptoms of HF include \nsymptoms caused by excessive fluid retention, \nsuch as dyspnea due to pulmonary congestion, \nabdominal distention from ascites, weight gain \nand peripheral edema, and symptoms caused by \ndecreased cardiac output, such as activities intol-\nerance, fatigue, hypotension, poor mentation, and \nweakness [1, 2].\nAs a chronic condition, HF imposes great bur -\ndens on the society. Around 38 million people \nworldwide are living with HF and the condition \nis becoming more common in both developing Y . Jiang (*) · W.

It is characterized by impaired cardiac function, leading to decreased cardiac output and insufficient blood supply to meet the body's metabolic demands. The condition can cause symptoms such as dyspnea, abdominal distention, weight gain, fatigue, hypotension, poor mentation, and weakness. Heart failure is a significant burden on society, particularly among the older population. Contributing factors of heart failure include systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, activation of neurohormonal and adrenergic pathways, and remodeling of the heart and blood vessels. The long-term stimulatory effects of these mechanisms can worsen the condition over time.\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
